# Woodland
Woodland is a singleplayer game, where each playerâ€™s objective is to cut as many timber as he/she can without the branches falling on them. The game is supposed to end if time lapses, or the player is hit by a branch. The game served to make the players more active and energetic as it is a stress reliever. The cooperation between the players to chop down as many trees as available on the screen serves to improve the bond between the players, relieve stress and help people going through difficult situations to calm down. It is a fun game that can be played by family or among friends thus it is not specific to a certain age group or individuals. There is only a single character, who can be customized by the player. Scores are earned from the number of chops made by the player.
